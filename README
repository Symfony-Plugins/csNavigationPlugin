= csNavigationPlugin plugin =

The csNavigationPlugin is a simple way to handle navigation in your applications.

csNavigationPlugin is working on Symfony 1.2.

== At a glance ==
 * A navigation object to manage multiple trees. All navigation is located under a single root to represent the sitemap
 * Navigation trees can be segmented by level and iteration (starting root, number of levels drilled down)
 * Automated active handling / expanding of children / route detection
 * Drive your navigation using a navigation.yml file or pull from your database, or both
 * A singleton who manages breadcrumbs. By default, a root item is present (text: Home, uri: @homepage)
 * A component who display the breadcrumbs
